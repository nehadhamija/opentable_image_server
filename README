Image Server

The server is implemented in GoLang. It provides all APIs required client by client. It also listens to new uploads on s3, resizes images and notifies clients.

The APIs provided by the server:

1. /new_image_notify POST
Receives SNS notification from AWS and is responsible for SNS subscription confirmation. Upon receiving a new image notification, the server locally resizes the image to desired dimensions, uploads to the output bucket and notifies clients that have registered through eventsource.

2. /upload_url GET
Get upload URL, that will allow clients to upload input images to the server.

3. /images GET
Get a list of image urls from s3 output(thumbnail) bucket.

4. /image_uploaded eventsource end-point
Eventsource endpoint for client to register for new (thumbnail) images.

Image Storage

All the images are stored in AWS S3. There's an input and an Output bucket.

The input bucket stores all the original uploaded imagees, there's a SNS notification to the server whenever a new image is uploaded to this bucket.

The output bucket has all the resized thumbnails uploaded by the server.
